# Faketernet

Basically the internet, in your computer

Faketernet is like the internet, built from scratch and stored in your device. It works just as the internet: you have a client session, a server and a database. It also implements its own protocol: FTTP (**F**ake**T**ernet **T**ransfer **P**rotocol)
